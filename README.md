## Commits

We use [semantic commit messages](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) to ensure a consistent style. We do this because this forces us to think about our process and because it leads to an easyly readible commit log.

### Predefined types

* `chore`: Commits related to project setup, build or continuous integration configuration
* `docs`: Commits related to documentation updates. Also applies if you update the documentation in code (jsdoc, `@doc` etc.)
* `feat`: Commits which add new features
* `fix`: Commits which fix a bug. Please add the issue id in the description if necessary
* `refact`: Commits which improve existing code without changing its functionality
* `style`: Commits which improve code style
* `test`: Commits which add/remove/improve tests
